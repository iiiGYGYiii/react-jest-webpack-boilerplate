# React Jest Webpack Boilerplate

This is a boilerplate for applications that use React and want to implement Testing with Jest, which is bundled with Webpack.

Just clone this repo and start coding.

## How to get started

You just have to install the dependencies, just run:
`npm install`

Then just run the development server
`npm run dev`

## How to build

Install the dependencies of the project running:
`npm install`

Then just run the following command:
`npm run build`

By default build is going to be stored in `./build folder`, you can modify this setting in `webpack.common.js` file.

If you don't need the implementation of Jest, please refer to:
